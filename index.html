<h2>Editor’s Note — 2026</h2>
<p>
This space began in 2025 as a quiet place to understand emotions I could not always explain aloud.
Over time, it became documentation of growth — in love, distance, and self-respect.
Every piece here represents a phase.
Some were written in confusion. Some in clarity.
But all of them are honest.
</p>
<p>— Monu Rajput</p>

<h2>Reflections</h2>

<div class="card">
Not every ending is a failure. Some are redirections in disguise.
</div>

<div class="card">
Silence is not weakness. It is often self-respect choosing peace.
</div>

<div class="card">
Love doesn’t fail. Expectations without understanding do.
</div>

<div class="card">
Sometimes distance is not rejection. It is protection.
</div>

<div class="card">
Emotional maturity begins where ego ends.
</div>

<div class="card">
Closure is not always given. Sometimes you create it yourself.
</div>

<h2>Selected Essay — 2026 Edition</h2>

<div class="card">
<h3>The Day I Understood Letting Go</h3>
<p>
There comes a moment in love when holding on becomes heavier than letting go.
That moment does not arrive loudly.
It arrives quietly, after repeated disappointments.
</p>

<div class="quote">
“Love should feel steady, not exhausting.”
</div>

<p>
Sometimes walking away is not weakness.
It is clarity choosing peace.
</p>

<h2>Understanding Modern Love — Series</h2>

<div class="card">
<h3>Part 1 — Attachment</h3>
We confuse attachment with love. One is fear of losing. The other is freedom to stay.
</div>

<div class="card">
<h3>Part 2 — Distance</h3>
Distance tests intention. Not feelings.
</div>

<div class="card">
<h3>Part 3 — Clarity</h3>
Clarity hurts at first. But confusion destroys slowly.
</div>

<h2>Philosophy</h2>

<div class="card">
Love is not about possession. It is about mutual growth.
</div>

<div class="card">
When respect fades, love quietly follows.
</div>

<div class="card">
Distance does not break strong bonds. Ego does.
</div>
